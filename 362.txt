China’s New Legislative Agenda: Unpacking China’s “Two Meetings”
 Monday, March 22, 2021 3:00 pm - 4:00 pm On March 4th, the annual convening of the National People’s Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) opened in Beijing amidst rising geopolitical tensions and a nascent domestic economic recovery. Among the important items on the legislative agenda is the formal promulgation of the 14th 5-year plan, as well as early signals about the country's ambitious plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.
On March 22nd, please join the CSIS China Power Project, Freeman Chair in China Studies, and Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics for an in-depth discussion of the NPC's policy and legislative outcomes, including possible signals about the future of U.S.-China relations.
This event is made possible through general support to CSIS.
