              An International Trade Policy Agenda for Environmental Sustainability: Directions for UK Leadership

          












      This event explores the opportunities in 2021 to develop a forward-looking international trade agenda on environmental sustainability.
    










In 2021, the UK is developing its independent trade policy and strategies to deliver an ambitious economic transition towards a low carbon economy. On the international stage, the UK has leadership roles as host of the COP26 on climate and of the G7.  2021 provides a timely and critical opening for UK leadership on a positive vision and agenda for international trade policy that builds more resilient and sustainable economies across the globe.  
This event will explore the opportunities in 2021 to develop a forward-looking international trade agenda on environmental sustainability. Speakers will identify opportunities for the UK to foster a new generation of trade agreements and partnerships in key international processes and organizations that could support the international community’s environmental sustainability goals and development commitments.
