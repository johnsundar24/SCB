Global trade in 2021: New year, new US administration… new outlook?


Panellists discuss the key trends that are likely to shape global trade in 2021, in particular the impact of a new Biden administration and the significance of trade as part of its domestic and international agenda.

2020 will be remembered as a significant year in the world of global trade. Rocked by the shocks of a global pandemic, trade also continued to be an important expression for President Trump’s politics and a key forum for international geopolitics, with this having real and significant implications for both citizens and businesses internationally.
A Biden presidency suggests a less antagonistic and more cooperative approach to trade policy. But will there be significant change in substance or just style from the new administration? And what does this mean for broader developments in global trade?
This panel discussion will explore the key trends that are likely to shape global trade in 2021, in particular the impact of a new Biden administration and the significance of trade as part of its domestic and international agenda.
Will trade be a priority for the new administration? Will a new administration lead to a substantial shift in US trade policy? And what are the implications of the new administration on areas such as transatlantic trade relations, US-China trade relations, and WTO reform?
As with all Chatham House events, members' questions drive the conversation. Register now to share, debate and develop ideas on this critical international issue.
