Road to COP26: Just Transitions and the Climate Agenda
 Tuesday, March 9, 2021 11:30 am - 12:45 pm The CSIS Energy Security & Climate Change Program and the Climate Investment Funds (CIF) are pleased to invite you to Road to COP26: Just Transitions and the Climate Agenda.
The event will examine the role of just transitions in the current international climate agenda, in the run-up to COP26 this November. Speakers will discuss how just transitions can help accelerate climate action and to what extent national climate plans are integrating aspects of inclusive decision-making and the fair distribution of emerging opportunities in the new climate economy. They will also share how they think COP26 can help raise ambitions for achieving just transitions.
Additional speaker to be announced.
This event is made possible by the generous funding from the Climate Investment Funds (CIF) as part of the Just Transition Intiative (JTI). For more information on the JTI, visit justtransitioninitiative.org.
