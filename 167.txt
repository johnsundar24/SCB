There is growing interest among regulators around the world in helping to address climate change through the levers of financial market regulation. In addition, private companies are starting to elevate the importance of climate and sustainability risk for investment decisions. These developments are essential for influencing the behavior of market participants towards low-carbon investments and mitigating climate risks for companies and investors.
On Tuesday, February 2, the Center on Regulation and Markets at Brookings hosted Larry Fink, chairman and CEO of BlackRock, and Mary Schapiro, vice chair of global public policy at Bloomberg L.P., former chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and head of the Secretariat of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, for a discussion on climate change and financial market regulations. This event shed light on ideas and trends in this increasingly important area.
