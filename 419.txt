The Africa Human Capital Plan, released in 2019, sets out clear targets and commitments to boost Sub-Saharan Africa’s potential through its human capital—the health, knowledge, skills, and resilience of its people. The continent’s young people are its greatest resource and the key to prosperity in a globalized and digitizing economy.Progress report | Overview | Deep Dives









STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Since the Africa Human Capital plan launched in 2019, the World Bank, countries, and communities have been boosting investments in Africa’s people.

World Bank human development project commitments have nearly doubled.

The COVID-19 crisis underscores the need to protect and bolster human capital in the overarching effort to save lives, promote well-being, and safeguard future productivity.









The World Bank’s Africa Human Capital Plan sets ambitious targets to be achieved in the region by 2023. These include a drastic reduction in child mortality to save 4 million lives, averting stunting among 11 million children, increasing learning outcomes for girls and boys in school by 20%, providing social protection to 13 million more people, reducing adolescent fertility rates by empowering women, and improving sanitation practices.We launched the plan in 2019, in response to Sub-Saharan Africa’s low scores on the World Bank’s Human Capital Index; a measurement of how well countries invest in the next generation of workers. The score is explained by high mortality and stunting rates in the region, as well as inadequate student learning outcomes – all of which have a direct effect on economic productivity. In 2020, a child born in a Sub-Saharan country could expect to achieve only 40% of his/her future productivity if she were to enjoy complete education and full health.Since the plan launched, the World Bank, countries, and communities have been boosting investments in Africa’s people. Highlights include a strong push to empower women and accelerate Africa’s demographic transition. Over 2.2 billion dollars has been committed in new women's empowerment projects. Our human development project commitments in the region have nearly doubled, and teams across the World Bank Group are stepping up to support human capital priorities, such as road safety in transport projects and electrification of all health centers and schools in Africa by 2030.The AHC plan is also innovative. A first generation of operations is supporting human capital policy reforms, such as stronger legal frameworks to protect women and children. New large-scale training for our staff and clients is expanding the use of geolocated data collected via mobile phones to improve project and service delivery.The COVID-19 crisis underscores the need to protect and bolster human capital in the overarching effort to save lives, promote well-being, and safeguard future productivity. Moving forward,  five gamechangers will be prioritized to accelerate human capital development in the face of the pandemic:Scaling up financing and policy reforms: Increasing allocation and efficiency of spending on human capital is needed to achieve results.Investing in women’s empowerment and demographic change: Empowering women and girls as agents of socioeconomic change is fundamental to realizing human capital gains.Addressing fragility and conflict: Protecting and preventing the loss of life in fragile and conflict settings and supporting displaced communities to increase human capital must be a major focus in Africa.Leveraging technology and innovation: Harnessing the opportunities that technology and innovation offer can accelerate improvements in human capital outcomes and productivity in many sectors.Building knowledge and partnerships: The World Bank and development partners are joining forces with partners to fulfill the potential of Africa’s greatest resource: its people.
