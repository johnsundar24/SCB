Securing America's Networks Against Chinese Security Threats 
 Tuesday, March 30, 2021 2:30 pm - 3:30 pm The U.S. government took unprecedented steps over the past four years to address national security threats posed by Huawei and other telecom entities controlled by Communist China.  As we transition into a new Administration, there are questions about the direction the U.S. will take going forward, particularly as the spread of 5G mobile networking is creating new opportunities for nations like China to leverage their control of key suppliers to advance their intelligence and security goals.
Join FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr as he highlight's key steps the U.S. has taken to secure America's networks and hear his thoughts on the path ahead, including additional actions he says the FCC should take to secure our 5G networks and address the use of Uyghur forced labor in the telecom supply chain. After providing keynote remarks, Commissioner Carr will join a panel of experts for an in-depth discussion of these issues.
This event is made possible thanks to general support to CSIS.
