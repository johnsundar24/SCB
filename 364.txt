Macrotrends to Watch in 2021
 Wednesday, March 10, 2021 9:00 am - 10:00 am One year into the pandemic, COVID-19 continues to reshape our world. But the course of the virus is hardly the only variable to watch in this era of shifting world order, massive environmental challenges, and the remaking of societies around technology. What drivers and indicators should we keep an eye on? And how are global macrotrends interacting with one another in new and sometimes unexpected ways?
The Risk and Foresight Group welcomes Dr. Erin Simpson, Director of Strategy Development and Deployment, Space Systems, at Northrop Grumman; Mr. Haim Israel, Managing Director of Research at Bank of America; and Mr. Nate Schenkkan, Director of Research Strategy at Freedom House for a broad discussion on the macrotrends that will play an outsized role in shaping 2021 and beyond.
This event is made possible through general support to CSIS.
