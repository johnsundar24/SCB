Strategic Partnerships and US-China Rivalry: Opportunities and Challenges for the Republic of Korea


This roundtable brings together experts to examine how the Republic of Korea is balancing its traditional close alliance partnership with the United States with the economic, political and social factors that make China a growing focal point for South Korea’s national interest.







              Research event
                          

29 October 2020 — 11:30AM TO 1:00PM

Online















This virtual roundtable builds on previous and ongoing research and events, as part of our Korea Foundation Korea Fellowship. This five-year fellowship is funded by The Korea Foundation and Yeosijae (Future Consensus Institute).
Specific questions to be discussed during this event include:
• What is China’s role in the denuclearization process on the Korean peninsula?
• With the Trump administration apparently willing to consider troop re-deployments from the peninsula and increasingly pressuring South Korea to assume a substantively increased share of host-nation support, how might the Moon administration respond and what implications might this have for security relations between China and South Korea?
• How does the China-South Korea-Japan trilateral element come into play?
• How will the outcome of the November presidential elections affect US relations with China and the ROK?
• What are the implications for the ROK’s relations with both China and the US should Kim Jong-un’s health deteriorate?
• How should Korean peninsula issues be handled while US-China relations are intensifying?
• What should be Seoul’s regional strategy amid US-China competition?
