World leaders met during the first Davos Agenda under the banner of rebuilding trust in a critical year
Heads of state and government, chief executives and civil society leaders urged collective action to combat climate change and emerge stronger from a pandemic that has strained lives and livelihoods
Partnerships and initiatives to address crucial economic, social and environmental challenges were launched
The conclusions from the Davos Agenda will feed into platforms, initiatives and projects for the upcoming Special Annual Meeting 2021 in Singapore 



Geneva, Switzerland, 29 January 2021 – The first virtual Davos Agenda closed today following calls from more than 24 heads of state and government and over 1,700 participants from business and civil society to address the crucial challenges facing us all. 


Setting the tone for the meeting were discussions about stakeholder capitalism, in which companies seek long-term value creation by taking into account the needs of all their stakeholders including society at large. This fed into more than 140 sessions, which considered the need for greater collaboration, placing sustainability and a green agenda at the heart of economic recoveries, and how to use technology to help achieve this. 


“We need to move from a world which is just based on material objectives, to one that is much more conscious of the wellbeing of people,” said Professor Klaus Schwab, the Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum. He added that “we are witnessing a mindset shift from short-term profit maximization, to “a world that is much more characterized by stakeholder responsibility”. 


Schwab said the pandemic has shown that companies committing to stakeholder capitalism perform much better because they invest in the long-term viability of the company. In Stakeholder Capitalism, he also called for a much wider definition of capital, one that includes “human, social and natural capital” because all those aspects combined to create wealth and prosperity. 


Sustainability and support for the vulnerable were emphasized. Special addresses and active participation from heads of state, government and international organizations discussed the importance of containing COVID-19 and working quickly to mitigate further fractures in society. Business leaders echoed these calls and urged cooperation and innovation to address crucial economic, social and environmental challenges in the year ahead.


World Economic Forum President Børge Brende said: “Recovering from the pandemic and shaping our future in a more equitable, sustainable and resilient manner can only happen if stakeholders work together.” He noted that “The most pressing issues we are facing do not recognize borders. But deep and meaningful global cooperation is not always a given. It requires deliberate action, one that focuses on people, the planet and prosperity, and where collaboration will be the defining element.” 


Below is a selection of outcomes, project milestones and new analysis from The Davos Agenda week.


Designing cohesive, sustainable, resilient economic systems  


· A global coalition of 54 organizations representing 13 industries and 6.5 million employees committed to building more equitable and just workplaces. The Partnering for Racial Justice in Business Initiative provides a platform for businesses to collectively advocate for inclusive policy change and set new global standards for racial equity. Each company commits to one tangible policy change, one board discussion and a new long-term strategy. 


· At the end of its first year, the Reskilling Revolution initiative announced that more than 50 million people overall have received support for developing new skills. The initiative will continue to scale up its skilling activities in its second year, while expanding its work in education, job creation and work standards, as well as setting new targets for inclusion.


· The Closing the Skills Gap country accelerators are developing and implementing national strategies for reskilling and upskilling. Reaching up to 47 million individuals, accelerators are active in 10 countries with Georgia, Greece and Turkey having recently established accelerators, and a further six accelerators under discussion for 2021.


· The Preparing for the Future of Work industry accelerators are now estimated to have reached nearly 8 million employees to prepare them with future-oriented skills.

· The Valuable 500, a global chief executive officer community transforming disability inclusion through business leadership, announced that more than 400 businesses have joined the initiative since launching at the Annual Meeting 2019 in Davos-Klosters. Each business commits to one tangible action for inclusion and one board discussion for longer-term reforms. 


· A new Global Taxonomy for skills was released in partnership with the Skills Consortium, representing more than 200 million online learners. Over the coming year the taxonomy will be adopted by business, government and education institutions to create a common language and comparability between skills in the workforce. 


· Upskilling for Shared Prosperity reveals that upskilling has the potential to boost GDP by $6.5 trillion and create 5.3 million jobs by 2030 and must be a core part of the next wave of fiscal stimulus from governments to combat the negative effects of the pandemic.


· The Lighthouse Projects on Social Justice and Sustainability Initiative will bring together leaders integrating social justice into their sustainability strategies. A comprehensive analysis and best practices will be produced later this year. 


· Global Shapers and Impactscool created Courageous Conversations, an interactive game offering individuals and organizations the opportunity to dig below the surface of the future workplace – engaging diverse, multigenerational stakeholders in dialogue on nine critical factors to shape the future of education and labour systems.


Driving responsible industry transformation and growth

· Although health systems have been disrupted by COVID-19, diseases like dementia carry on and will affect 150 million families by 2050.

Enhancing stewardship of the global commons 


· To feed 10 billion people sustainably by 2050 requires innovation in how we produce and consumer food in different ways, in different countries. To accelerate this innovation, a network of Food Innovation Hubs has been launched by the Forum and key partners around the world. They will provide inputs to the forthcoming UN Food Systems Summit. 


· A new report, Nature and Net Zero, highlights the potential of natural climate solutions to deliver one-third of the carbon emissions reductions needed by 2030.

· The Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders welcomed a new report that identified how eight supply chains account for more than 50% of global emissions and fully decarbonizing these would add just 1%-4% to end-consumer costs. The report outlined nine ways to do this and how to get started. 


· The Mission Possible Partnership is a new coalition bringing together more than 400 companies to forge net-zero pathways and the actions necessary to achieve them.

· Underpinning many of the sessions throughout the week were the findings of the Global Risks Report 2021, released just before the start of The Davos Agenda.
