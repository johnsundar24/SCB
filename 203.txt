Ensuring an equitable workforce post-COVID


Panelists discuss the effects the coronavirus pandemic has had on the world of work, focusing on the driving factors behind the unequal distribution of impact and potential long-term effects on the post-COVID labour force.

The coronavirus pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the world of work. COVID-19 has not only dramatically shifted how, where and when we work, but indeed if we worked. Moreover, what has become clear is that the job security of some workers has been more affected than others and jobs held by minority groups, women, young workers, low paid workers and disabled workers have been disproportionately impacted. The economic consequences of the pandemic have highlighted existing vulnerabilities and entrenched inequalities in the world of work. 
The panellists on this webinar discuss the driving factors behind the unequal distribution of impact and potential long-term effects on the post-COVID labour force. How can the data be used to identify fragilities and structural problems within the labour market and how can policymakers correct these? What underlying factors are contributing to this disproportionate impact on certain cohorts of workers? What steps should the corporate sector take to retain a diverse and inclusive workforce now and build a more flexible and equitable workplace in the future?
 As with all Chatham House events, members' questions drive the conversation. Register now to share, debate and develop ideas on this critical international issue.
