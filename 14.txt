With the capabilities and implications of emerging new technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) still largely unknown, it is critical that the next generation of policies and norms be informed by ideals of economic and national security, transparency, fairness, and inclusion. In light of this, the next presidential administration will need to confront a wide array of challenging tech issues while implementing best practices that properly balance both the benefits and risks for society.
On January 7, Governance Studies at Brookings hosted a webinar to discuss how to advance good governance of transformative new technologies. Brookings experts examined how AI is being deployed and identify how to mitigate risks across a broad range of areas such as finance, manufacturing, education, health care, and national defense.
Viewers submitted questions for speakers via email to events@brookings.edu or via Twitter at @BrookingsGov or by using #AIGovernance.
