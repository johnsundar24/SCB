Sustainable Finance in Emerging Markets – Views from Asia was part of the IIF ESG Webinar Series, which was designed to promote understanding of the rapidly evolving landscape for ESG disclosure and to align efforts to measure and track climate finance.  The objective of this ESG webinar was to discuss sustainable finance efforts in emerging markets (EM). This was the second in a series of ESG webinars focusing on EM expertise from different regions. This webinar spotlighted views from Emerging Asia. 


On March 10 we were delighted to discuss the future of the sustainable finance agenda in EM Asia with Luanne Sieh from CIMB Group, and learn more about key challenges and opportunities for financial institutions in the region, what drives the regulatory landscape, and the state of play on climate and ESG disclosure practices. 

Topics discussed: 
Key drivers of the sustainability agenda in the region 
The pace of sustainability integration across corporates in EM Asia 
Sustainable business development and competition –risks and opportunities 
Investment stewardship and the role of the financial institutions 
The increasing role of ESG in mobilizing private capital flows into Asia 


FEATURED SPEAKER:
Luanne Sieh, Head, Group Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility, CIMB Group



HOST:
Sonja Gibbs, Managing Director and Head of Sustainable Finance, IIF
