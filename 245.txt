The future of global trade


What issues top the global trade agenda?







              Research event
                          

16 February 2021 — 4:00PM TO 5:00PM

Online















While global trade is recovering following the COVID-19 induced slump, many challenges remain. Efforts to reconfigure global value chains and to secure supply of essential goods raise new questions around trade, industrial policy and competition.
What is the outlook for trade relations between the US, China and Europe, as well as other key players – and the future for trade governance more broadly? How can greater cooperation on trade and sustainability be fostered? And what issues will be at the top of the agenda for the next head of the World Trade Organization?
This discussion is part of the Chatham House Global Trade Policy Forum. We would like to take this opportunity to thank founding partner AIG and supporting partners, Clifford Chance LLP, Diageo plc, EY, and UPS for their generous support of the forum.
