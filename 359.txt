Global Networks 2030
Developing Economies and Emerging Technologies Monday, March 29, 2021 7:00 pm - 7:45 pm Read Report Here
The U.S.-China technology competition is set to intensify in third markets as developing countries decide which communications systems to adopt. China is already advancing its own vision—the Digital Silk Road—and positioning itself to benefit commercially and strategically as populations grow and more of the world comes online. Join CSIS for a discussion of key economic trends, emerging technologies, and strategic options for defending global networks through 2030. 
Discussion featuring
Ken Watanabe, Director-General for International Affairs, Global Strategy Bureau, MIC
Diane Rinaldo, Executive Director, Open RAN Policy Coalition
Jonathan E. Hillman, Senior Fellow and Director of the Reconnecting Asia Project, CSIS
Moderated by
Matthew P. Goodman, Senior Vice President for Economics and Simon Chair in Political Economy
This event was made possible by support from Japan’s Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications and Mitsubishi UFJ Research & Consulting Co., Ltd.
