COP26 Diplomatic Briefing Series


Chatham House is organizing monthly briefings to discuss the most pressing climate issues with UK and international government officials and experts.























In November 2021, the UK is hosting the UN’s annual climate change conference (COP26), in partnership with Italy. The conference is considered to be the most important climate summit since 2015's COP21 in Paris and its main aim is to increase climate ambition – on mitigation, adaptation and finance.
In the run-up to COP26, Chatham House is organizing monthly briefings for diplomats and other government officials worldwide. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are currently hosting all events online. Since January 2020, the diplomatic briefings have covered a range of pertinent topics, like climate finance; adaptation and resilience; the energy transition; and the shifting politics of the UN climate negotiations.
Speakers have included H.E Ban Ki-Moon (8th Secretary General of the UN; Chair of the Board of the Global Center on Adaptation; Deputy Chair of the Elders), Tenzin Wangmo (Lead Negotiator for the Least Developed Countries Group), the Rt Hon Anne-Marie Trevelyan (UK International Champion on Adaptation and Resilience for the COP26 Presidency; Minister for Business, Energy and Clean Growth), Archie Young (the UK’s Lead Climate Negotiator), and H.E. Saida Muna Tasneem (High Commissioner of Bangladesh to the UK, Ireland and Liberia).
Would you like to receive invitations to the diplomatic briefings? Please email Anna Aberg, Research Analyst.
Chatham House is also producing a podcast – the Climate Briefing – which follows the themes of the diplomatic briefings. All episodes are available below and on all major podcast platforms.
