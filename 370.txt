              Redesigning for the environment

          












      Hear from designers and policymakers on how radical design thinking can deliver transformative ideas to build a more environmentally sustainable world through our landscapes and localities.
    










The COVID-19 crisis has demonstrated the urgent need for us to radically rethink places and spaces to be both environmentally sustainable and just. Global lockdowns have shown the disparity in access to green spaces in cities, ones that could also increase urban biodiversity.
At the same time, the materials and design techniques used in our cities can play a vital part in meeting global net-zero targets, provide both social and environmental outcomes at the local level, as well as increase resilience in the face of the bigger and diverse shocks the planet faces from the climate and biodiversity crises now and in the future.
This event is an incredible opportunity to hear from designers and policymakers on how radical design thinking can deliver transformative policies and ideas to build a more environmentally sustainable world through our landscapes and localities.
What does an environmentally sustainable city look like, and how can cities become both sustainable, resilient and inclusive through design and policy?
How do we increase connection to the natural world through the design of places to the benefit of both people and the planet?
What materials and design techniques can be used that make our cities more sustainable?
This event is produced as part of SNF CoLab – our project to share our ideas with you in experimental, collaborative ways – and to learn how you think we can design a better future.
