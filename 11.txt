America and the world are entering a new chapter of policymaking, offering a renewed opportunity for fact-based federal policy solutions to counter the unprecedented impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the disparities it has laid bare, and to ensure prosperity for Americans from all walks of life. Against this backdrop, Brookings’s Blueprints for American Renewal & Prosperity provides a series of innovative, implementable federal policy ideas to inform a new presidency and Congress.
On January 6, Brookings hosted the second event in the Blueprints series, focused on addressing the acute and chronic problems facing our nation’s vulnerable workers and communities of color. A panel of scholars discussed ideas for how tax policy, housing policy, and entrepreneurship support could help narrow vast racial wealth disparities and promote a more inclusive and just recovery from the pandemic’s economic crisis.
Viewers submitted questions by emailing events@brookings.edu or tweeting to @BrookingsMetro using the hashtag #BrookingsBlueprints.
