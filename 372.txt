              Fostering Resilience in Emerging Oil Producers

          












      Exploring how COVID-19 changed the prospects of the 30 member countries of the New Producers Group, and reflecting on how they can adapt to the ‘new normal’.
    










One year ago, as the COVID-19 pandemic closed public life in cities from Kampala to Paramaribo, the New Producers Group started a series of online discussions to review the impact of the crisis on the oil sector. The meetings examined the impacts felt in the countries just starting off in the oil and gas sector and those expected to in the future, as the world transitions to a decarbonized economy.
In this event, Valerie Marcel shares the conclusions of the paper Fostering Resilience in Emerging Oil Producers. The paper captures these discussions, detailing how COVID-19 changed the prospects of the 30 member countries of the New Producers Group, and reflects on how they can adapt to the ‘new normal’.
Guest speakers from emerging producer countries share current policy implications, as governments contemplate next steps, as well as questions arising from local communities.
