The Platform for Collaboration on Tax Launches Tax Treaty Negotiations Toolkit
March 10, 2021
Washington, DC: 
The Platform for Collaboration on Tax (PCT) — a joint initiative of the
IMF, OECD, UN, and World Bank Group – released the final version of the
Toolkit on Tax Treaty Negotiations along with its web-based, interactive
edition.


The PCT’s Toolkit on Tax Treaty Negotiations

is an effort to provide capacity-building support to developing countries
on tax treaty negotiations, building on existing guidance, particularly
from the UN Manual for the Negotiation of Bilateral Tax Treaties between
Developed and Developing Countries. The toolkit describes the steps
involved in tax treaty negotiations, such as how to decide whether a
comprehensive tax treaty is necessary, how to prepare for and conduct
negotiations, and what follow-up measures to take after negotiations.
Treaty negotiating teams, especially those new to the process, can also
find practical tips on the conduct of negotiations and negotiation styles.
Additionally, the toolkit collates links to publicly available resources
that treaty negotiators will find useful, making them easily accessible.
The design of the toolkit allows regular updates and improvements based on
the feedback from users and experienced negotiators.


This is the fifth toolkit published by the PCT, a collective effort of the
PCT Partners to help countries address challenges in international
taxation. The final version of the toolkit takes into account extensive
comments received from countries and stakeholders during the public
consultation process in June–September 2020. In addition to written
comments, public consultation webinars, which were held in English, French,
and Spanish in November and December 2020, gathered further feedback from
diverse stakeholders, particularly treaty negotiation teams.


Following the release, the Toolkit on Tax Treaty Negotiations, including
its full web-based version, will be launched at

a three-day workshop

on March 11, 12, and 15, 2021. The virtual workshop will feature expert
speakers and experienced negotiators, who will discuss some of the
substantive issues addressed in the toolkit, such as designing a tax treaty
policy framework and the steps involved in the preparation for, conduct of,
and follow-up after negotiations.


French and Spanish versions of the Toolkit will be available in the coming
days. For more information, please visit:
