Director's briefing: A global economic outlook for 2021


Global Chief Economist at Citi, Catherine Mann, provides her forecasts and perspectives for the global economy in 2021. 







              Partner and major corporate event
                          

14 January 2021 — 1:00PM TO 2:00PM

Online















As an increasing number of countries approve vaccines and roll out immunisation programmes, spirits are high and global markets up. But while there is growing hope that the pandemic might be better contained in 2021, the virus is expected to continue to rattle the global economy with UN estimates suggesting that the crisis will cost the world economy $8.5 trillion in output over the next two years.
Against this backdrop, Global Chief Economist at Citi Catherine Mann will provide her forecasts and perspectives for the global economy in 2021. To what extent will this year present governments, businesses and fiscal authorities with an opportunity to build back more sustainable and inclusive economies? Can climate investment save the economy? What will be needed to address corporate insolvencies, high unemployment and escalating debt problems in emerging and developing economies? And what are the real-world implications for workers, various industries and age groups?This event is only open to Chatham House Partners and Major Corporate Members as well as selected giving circles of Chatham House. If you would like to attend, please RSVP to Linda Bedford at RSVP@chathamhouse.org.
