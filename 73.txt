Online Event: A new transatlantic agenda: A conversation with EU Director General of DG Trade, Sabine Weyand
 Friday, January 15, 2021 9:00 am - 10:00 am In December 2020, the European Commission released a proposal outlining areas where global leadership and strong transatlantic as well as multilateral cooperation are urgently needed to address the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change, technology governance and digital trade as well as foreign and security policy. As the U.S. and Europe account for a third of global trade, this U.S.-EU “reset” seeks to strengthen the “West” in order to develop shared approaches to global challenges, such as China.
We are honored to have Sabine Weyand, EU Director General of DG Trade, to discuss the EU’s new transatlantic agenda for global change. This discussion will be moderated by Bill Reinsch, CSIS Scholl Chair and Senior Adviser, and Heather Conley, Senior Vice President for Europe, Eurasia, and the Arctic and Director of the Europe Program at CSIS. We hope you will be able to join us for what is sure to be an engaging and informative discussion.
This event is made possible by general CSIS support.
