Fortifying Power Africa
Recommendations to Advance Core Economic, Development, and National Security Goals in Sub-Saharan Africa Wednesday, March 24, 2021 10:00 am - 11:00 am As the Biden administration develops policies and priorities for renewed engagement with Africa, there is an urgency to reexamine and revamp U.S. signature initiatives. Power Africa, an interagency initiative coordinated by the US Agency for International Development (USAID), is at the top of the to-do list. Power Africa’s goal has been to expand electricity access and improve electricity supply in the region. Since its launch in 2013, it has helped connect more than 18 million homes and businesses to electricity and brought over 11,000 megawatts (MW) of new generation to financial close.
A new report led by the Energy for Growth Hub argues that the initiative presents the Biden administration with opportunities to accelerate progress in tackling poverty and help address some of its highest priority foreign policy and development goals. And it makes 10 recommendations for enhancing the program’s effectiveness. Please join the CSIS Africa Program and the Energy for Growth Hub for a joint public event to discuss key findings and recommendations from the report. CSIS Africa Program Director Judd Devermont will moderate a conversation with co-authors and panelists Katie Auth, policy director at the Energy for Growth Hub, Nilmini Rubin, senior associate at CSIS, and Kate Steel, co-founder and COO at Nithio. All have been closely involved in creating and shaping Power Africa over the years.
This event is made possible through CSIS general support.
