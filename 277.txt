Topics: 
Operational risk




With this document, the Basel Committee seeks to promote a principles-based approach to improving operational resilience. The principles aim to strengthen banks' ability to withstand operational risk-related events that could cause significant operational failures or wide-scale disruptions in financial markets, such as pandemics, cyber incidents, technology failures or natural disasters. The approach builds on revisions to the Committee's Principles for the sound management of operational risk, and draws from previously issued principles on corporate governance for banks, as well as outsourcing-, business continuity- and relevant risk management-related guidance.
