              Climate Action and Gender Equality: Can We Close One Gap Without the Other?

          












      This event organized by the COP26 presidency in partnership with Chatham House, explores how gender equality and climate action go hand-in-hand.
    










Marking International Women's Day, this event organized by the COP26 presidency in partnership with Chatham House, will explore how gender equality and climate action go hand-in-hand. The agreement of the Gender Action Plan (GAP) at COP25 sent the message that the time for gender-responsive climate action is now.
This will be a unique opportunity to hear from policymakers and civil society leaders discussing whether enough is being done, as well as highlighting cutting-edge work around the world and suggesting what the future could hold.
The event will be livestreamed on this event page.
