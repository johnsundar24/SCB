As a new presidential administration and Congress take office amid compounding historic challenges, Brookings’s Blueprints for American Renewal & Prosperity provides a series of innovative, implementable federal policy ideas to inform a new presidency and Congress. In the essays discussing climate and resilience, Brookings scholars lay out policies that respond to the climate crisis both domestically and abroad. They draw from expertise to suggest federal policies to help the United States achieve its emission reduction goals, strengthen our resilience to the inevitable changes in climate that will occur, and reinvigorate our international efforts to encourage greater climate ambition and learn from our global partners.
On Tuesday, March 2, Brookings hosted the final event in the Blueprints series, focused on addressing climate change mitigation and resilience. A panel of scholars discussed ideas from Blueprints briefs related to preparing students and workers for emerging job fields, incentivizing resilient businesses, reducing federal climate risk, and managing the federal government’s own exposure to climate-related risks. Underpinning all of these related topics is the imperative to reengage and lead the global community.
Viewers submitted questions by emailing events@brookings.edu or tweeting @BrookingsMetro using the hashtag #BrookingsBlueprints.

Watch the first Blueprints for American Renewal & Prosperity event focused on economic growth and dynamism here , the second event on racial justice and worker mobility here, the third event on international security here, the fourth event on domestic governance reform here, and the fifth event on international governance reform here.
